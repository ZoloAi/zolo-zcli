v1.5.1: Critical Bug Fixes + User Manager Demo

Fixed 8 critical bugs in zWalker/zData/zDialog integration:
- Menu navigation now jumps to selected keys correctly
- Dialog forms submit cleanly without model pollution
- zData dispatcher properly recognizes and routes requests
- Read/Insert/Update/Delete operations use correct table names
- Select method accepts keyword arguments as expected
- Insert operations accept data dictionaries from forms
- User-friendly error messages guide proper database setup
- Added pause after read results for better UX (default: on, configurable)

Added User Manager demo (Demos/User Manager/):
- Complete production-ready CRUD application
- Zero SQL, zero UI code - everything in YAML
- Demonstrates all framework capabilities
- Included in Git repo, not in pip package

All 560 tests passing (100%). Verified with full CRUD workflow.
